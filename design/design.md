### Design decisions
We followed the diagonal format, where the top few lines are longer and the bottom few lines are shorter.

We also clumped together all the tasks, since they are associated together, with the completed tasks on top.

### Alternative designs
We decided to use green for the "Done" and "Add" buttons,
since green is associated with growing, natural, and successful. 
Similarly, we used red for the "Delete completed" button, since apps typically use green for yes and red for no.

### User testing
We tested with one potential user who gave us critical insights. She commented on whether having a "Done" button is
necessary and that "Add a todo" can be shortened as "Add" and "Delete Completed" can be shorted as "Delete." Since this
is an early stage in development, we are still keeping the design as it is, but we will definitely take them into
consideration. She also mentioned that "Add a todo" and "Delete Completed" buttons should be at the bottom; we agree
with this and are likely to implement this change as we move onto making this more dynamic.

### Challenges we faced
We had a bit of trouble in the beginning with getting used to pulling before doing any work and pushing after completing 
some tasks. We also found it difficult to make these design choices when they are so static; we are excited to move onto
making these pages and buttons dynamic!

### Parts of the design we're most proud of
We feel proud of our color and font choices. The font is light-hearted and encouraging of completing tasks; the maroon
color is clearly indicative of deleting, but the color is not too alarming or aggressive. The green colors are fitting
for "Done" and "Add a todo," but easy to distinguish as they have different shades.
